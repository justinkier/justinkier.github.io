# Top level header, aka H1

H1 is the most important header.

## Second level header

This gets converted to an H2

### Third-level header

VuePress indexes only up to H3 for its searches

#### Level 4 header, aka H4

People remember only about 3 levels of a hierarchy

##### H5

Who goes this low? and why?

###### H6

A level 6 header is used only by spelunkers.

Normal text isn't indexed by VuePress's internal search.
